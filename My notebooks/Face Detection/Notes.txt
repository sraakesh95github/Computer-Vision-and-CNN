Concepts (Viola - Jones algorithm):
1. Separate feature detection:
-> Edge
-> Line
-> Checker

2. Computation: 
-> (Average of darker regions) - (Average of lighter regions)
-> Threshold to be set that defines whether the particular feature has passed or not

3. Use of "Integral Image" for faster computation with a running time of O(1). It is also called as a "Summed Area Table"

4. Time saving - Cascade of Classifiers

5. RGB (face image - portrait preferably) -> Convert to grayscale (light to dark features) -> Edge features indicating the eyes and the cheeks (Uses the cascade of classifiers) -> Search for the next feature line detection (Uses the cascade of classifiers)

6. Disadvantage: A large pre-trained sets of features or datasets is required for the cascade of classifiers

7. OPenCV has pre-trained XML files for Haar Cascade
